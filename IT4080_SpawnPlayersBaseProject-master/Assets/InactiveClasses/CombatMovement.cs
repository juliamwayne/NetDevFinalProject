    //Every character will have this script.
    //It is the general class for movement in combat.
    //I have 2 options:
    // 1. Make a grid that generates when combat begins. The characters can move so many squares.
    // 2. Pick up mouse movement. A vector is generated from the character to the mouse. The character can move a distance vector away.
